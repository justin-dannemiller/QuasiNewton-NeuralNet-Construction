## This directory stores data files for the datasets used in the original Quasi-Newton for Feedforward Neural Network Construction Paper
1) University of Wisconsin's Breast Cancer Dataset
    - All data for the UW Breast Cancer dataset is stored in the [breast-cancer-wisconsin.data](Breast_Cancer_Dataset/breast-cancer-wisconsin.data) file.
2) k-bit Parity Dataset
    - The k-bit parity problem is to predict the parity (even/odd) of a given bit string based on all bits in the string.
    - As such, the dataset for this problem (bit strings and their parities) is efficiently generated rather than stored.
