# QuasiNewton-NeuralNet-Construction
A reproduction of the Quasi-Newton Feedforward Neural Network Construction Algorithm

## Deployment
* To run the FNNCA algorithm on one of the datasets, run the [*reproduce_study_results.ipynb*](reproduce_study_results.ipynb) file.

## Debugging
* All other utility functinons used to run the algorithm are stored in the [*Utils*](Utils) directory. 
- Modify any of the functions in this directory's scripts to debug/make functionality improvements. 
- Changes in those scripts are automatically reloaded in the main notebook.
